Queue: it can be thought of as like a container of sorts where
records or pieces of data enter on one end of this container and then
exit on the other.

Note: we should only expose queue methods (unshift and pop) outside of the class else it will be treated as an array.

One possible reason to use a Queue instead array by hiding all the other 
functions of an array is the performance.
